## Biotope Resource Loader
The [biotope-resource-loader](https://github.com/biotope/biotope-resource-loader) makes it easy for
you to load the components you built with biotope-element like so:

```html
<my-button data-resources="[{paths: ['path/to/js/my-button.js']}]"></my-button>
```

This will load the script and attatch it to the dom.
