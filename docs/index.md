`biotope-element` is a library to create Web Components in a simple way, taking advantage of simple
yet powerful concepts from other frontend libraries to empower you, the developer, and your clients'
needs - be them integration with popular CMSs or developing amazing design-systems to be used
anywhere.

`biotope-element` uses mostly vanilla web technologies and is built with the intention of being used
for component development and not page assembly. This means we dedicate ourselves to making sure
that page assembly libraries like React, Vue or Angular have the best possible experience when using
our components. This also means that every piece of knowledge you have about HTMLElements is
applicable when working with `biotope-element`.

This documentation shows you how `biotope-element` works and how to create components using it. It
also assumes that you have no knowledge of what a Web Component is, which means we will explain some
Web Component concepts as we go along but not all and certainly not to an unnecessary depth. You can
read more about Web Components [here](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction).

## Installation
You can install the biotope element in your project using npm:

```bash
npm install @biotope/element
```

or yarn

```bash
yarn add @biotope/element
```

After that, import it in your components like so:

```javascript
import Component from '@biotope/element';
```

Alternatively you can use unpkg to insert `biotope-element` into your HTML for quick testing through
our minified ES5 file available [here](https://unpkg.com/@biotope/element/lib/biotope-element.min.js).

## Your first component
To use `biotope-element`, you have to extend it with your custom class.

After defining your class, you have to call the `register` function. Here's a minimal example of a
working component:

```javascript
// my-button.js
import Component from '@biotope/element';

export class MyButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return this.html`
      Hello World üê§
    `;
  }
}

MyButton.componentName = 'my-button';
MyButton.register();
```

After that you can use it in your html like so:

```html
<script src="my-button.js"></script>
<my-button></my-button>
```

This will result in the following html:

```html
<script src="my-button.js"></script>
<my-button>
  Hello world üê§
</my-button>
```

> __üìù Note:__ It's irrelevant where the `script` is placed. But remember that the component will only start
to render after the `script` is parsed and the component is registered.

## Compatibility and Polyfills
Natively, Web Components are not supported by all browsers - this includes `biotope-element`. You
can check out a list of compatible browsers using [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#search=Custom%20Elements%20v1).

To get it to work on almost all non-dead browsers, you can use [these polyfills](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills).
You can also checkout their [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs)
or you can simply put a script pointing to [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@2.3.0/webcomponents-loader.js)
which will load only the necessary polyfills.

> __‚ö†Ô∏è Important:__ Remember to make sure that the polyfill is fully loaded before attempting to
register any component. This is done via the `WebComponentsReady` event or by a blocking script tag.
