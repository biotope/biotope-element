This is a list of new `biotope-element` features we have decided to experiment with. None of these
features are guaranteed to be available on the package itself.

If you want to give us feedback on these experiments, please do so on our issues on github. Each
experiment below will have it linked at the bottom.

> __⚠️ Important:__ We will do our best to keep these versions as stable as possible, but they are
still not recommended to be used in a production system as their API, availability and location may
change - which will most likely cause your build to stop working without warning.
