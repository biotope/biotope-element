# Contributing to biotope-element

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Building the Project
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

## Using the issue tracker
The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests.

## Bug reports
A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:
1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
3. Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

## Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests
Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

## Documentation Enhancements
Good documentation is as important as functional code.

Code examples should provide real life usecases, so please try to stay away from `foo` or `bar`. Try to find a good spot to add your enhancements. To review your changes locally you can run `npm run docs`
